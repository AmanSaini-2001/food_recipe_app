Welcome to Recipe Mania, a web application built with React.js and Axios that helps us to explore different recipes. 
Used Axios to make requests to the Meal DB API, which provides a vast collection of food recipes. 
In this Recipe Mania used asynchronous API calls, handled responses, and updated the state of React components with the retrieved recipe data.

Project Description:

Recipe Mania is a food application that serves as a quick and convenient collection of recipes in your pocket. The main function of the application is the recipe search feature in which a regularly updated collection of recipes can be sorted through using any keywords that a user might use.
